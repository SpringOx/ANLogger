// So here's the situation.
// Extended attributes are perfect for what we're trying to do here (marking files as archived).
// This is exactly what extended attributes were designed for.
//
// But Apple screws us over on the simulator.
// Everytime you build-and-go, they copy the application into a new folder on the hard drive,
// and as part of the process they strip extended attributes from our log files.
// Normally, a copy of a file preserves extended attributes.
// So obviously Apple has gone to great lengths to piss us off.
//
// Thus we use a slightly different tactic for marking log files as archived in the simulator.
// That way it "just works" and there's no confusion when testing.
//
// The difference in method names is indicative of the difference in functionality.
// On the simulator we add an attribute by appending a filename extension.
//
// For example:
// log-ABC123.txt -> log-ABC123.archived.txt

 * Log File Rolling:
 *
 * maximumFileSize:
 *   The approximate maximum size to allow log files to grow.
 *   If a log file is larger than this value after a log statement is appended,
 *   then the log file is rolled.
 *
 * rollingFrequency
 *   How often to roll the log file.
 *   The frequency is given as an NSTimeInterval, which is a double that specifies the interval in seconds.
 *   Once the log file gets to be this old, it is rolled.
 *
 * Both the maximumFileSize and the rollingFrequency are used to manage rolling.
 * Whichever occurs first will cause the log file to be rolled.
 *
 * For example:
 * The rollingFrequency is 24 hours,
 * but the log file surpasses the maximumFileSize after only 20 hours.
 * The log file will be rolled at that 20 hour mark.
 * A new log file will be created, and the 24 hour timer will be restarted.
 *
 * You may optionally disable rolling due to filesize by setting maximumFileSize to zero.
 * If you do so, rolling is based solely on rollingFrequency.
 *
 * You may optionally disable rolling due to time by setting rollingFrequency to zero (or any non-positive number).
 * If you do so, rolling is based solely on maximumFileSize.
 *
 * If you disable both maximumFileSize and rollingFrequency, then the log file won't ever be rolled.
 * This is strongly discouraged.
